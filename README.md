### Introduction

Hey, im a first year student at Noroff Front-end. Our task is to make a science museum website for kids between 7-14 years of age. From my research of science museum website, do i feel they have a very clean and sterile look to them. I feel that look works more towards the parents. So i wanted to create something that looks and feels more kid friendly. More stop motion, game feel of the page.

### The plan

[Roadmap](https://github.com/users/KjetilHHauger/projects/3/views/4)


My 4-week website development plan follows a structured approach. Over a 7-day design period, you begin with a day of Lo Fi design, exploring various ideas for mobile presentation. Subsequently, you transition to Mid Fi, blocking out and refining designs for tablets and desktops, with flexibility for adjustments based on on-screen appearance. 
The Hi Fi wireframe phase prioritizes font, color palette, and active state considerations.
Post-design, attention shifts to the navbar and footer, pivotal components across all pages.  

Testing using Lighthouse and markup validation ensures adherence to criteria before implementation, showcasing a commitment to quality.
Page-specific visions include an animated rocket on the Index page, aiming for a clean design to emphasize exhibition sites. 

The event page incorporates color and filler text, while Exhibition pages feature vibrant designs and moving elements for added engagement. 

The information page prioritizes simplicity for optimal readability.
Your planned 2-week development period focuses on animation work, responsive design, and rigorous testing for accessibility and SEO using Lighthouse. 

The final week is allocated for addressing unforeseen challenges, bug fixing, and overall site refinement.
