# Science Museum: A School Project

![Science Museum Logo](/assets/images/logo.webp)

Crafted specifically for children aged 7-14, this project, developed as part of my coursework at Noroff Front-end, aims to engage young minds with a playful and interactive approach while providing educational content in a format that captivates their interest.

## Description

As a first-year student at Noroff Front-end, I have focused on creating a science museum website that deviates from the conventional sterile aesthetics typically targeted at adults. My goal was to design a more engaging and playful experience that appeals directly to children, inspired by my background in kindergarten education.

### Features

- **Animation**: Smooth and child-friendly animations that capture attention and encourage interaction.
- **Kid-Friendly Design**: A vibrant and engaging interface designed to appeal directly to children.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully adaptable interface, suitable for a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Compliant with WCAG standards to ensure it is accessible to all users.
