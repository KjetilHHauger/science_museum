## Introduction

As a first-year student at Noroff Front-end, I have focused on creating a science museum website that deviates from the conventional sterile aesthetics typically targeted at adults. My goal was to design a more engaging and playful experience that appeals directly to children, inspired by my background in kindergarten education.

## The Plan and Execution

The design and development process was carefully tailored to balance simplicity with engaging elements to captivate the young audience. This included:
- **Minimalist Design**: Adopting a clean, simple design strategy to hold the attention spans influenced by platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
- **Interactive Elements**: Using JavaScript for interactive features and Leaflet.js for an interactive map, ensuring the site is not only informative but also engaging.

"Explorify" is more than just a project; it's an initiative to inspire a love for science in young minds through interactive learning and creativity. This journey through the semester has been a profound blend of creativity, technology, and education, setting a foundation for future enhancements.
