### Introduction

Hey, im a first year student at Noroff Front-end. Our task is to make a science museum website for kids between 7-14 years of age. From my research of science museum website, do i feel they have a very clean and sterile look to them. I feel that look works more towards the parents. So i wanted to create something that looks and feels more kid friendly. More stop motion, game feel of the page.

### The plan

[Roadmap](https://github.com/users/KjetilHHauger/projects/3/views/4)

In undertaking the semester project, my design instincts, shaped by years in kindergarten settings, naturally directed the creation of an engaging platform primarily catering to the lower end of the age group. The project, titled "Explorify," focuses on delivering an immersive experience for children, complemented by information pages tailored for accompanying adults.
The design process unfolded seamlessly, with animations tested to strike a balance between engagement and simplicity. While coding, minor adjustments were made, particularly on information pages, refining the visual appeal for the target audience. The development journey involved dedicated efforts, with JavaScript proving instrumental in adding interactivity and functionality.
Embracing the era of short attention spans prevalent in platforms like YouTube and TikTok, the pages adopt a minimalist design. The project intentionally keeps information concise, aiming to spark curiosity and prompt visits to the museum for deeper exploration.
Visual elements from freepik.com, a logo generated through Copilot with DALL-E, and tools like Leaflet.js with osm-generator for the interactive map contribute to the project's vibrant and user-friendly nature.
"Explorify" serves as a testament to the seamless integration of creativity and functionality in front-end development, providing a visually stimulating, interactive, and educational platform for the Science Museum's younger audience. This semester-long journey reflects a commitment to fostering an early love for science exploration among the curious minds aged 7-14.
