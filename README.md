My 4-week website development plan follows a structured approach. Over a 7-day design period, you begin with a day of Lo Fi design, exploring various ideas for mobile presentation. Subsequently, you transition to Mid Fi, blocking out and refining designs for tablets and desktops, with flexibility for adjustments based on on-screen appearance. 
The Hi Fi wireframe phase prioritizes font, color palette, and active state considerations.
Post-design, attention shifts to the navbar and footer, pivotal components across all pages.  

Testing using Lighthouse and markup validation ensures adherence to criteria before implementation, showcasing a commitment to quality.
Page-specific visions include an animated rocket on the Index page, aiming for a clean design to emphasize exhibition sites. 

The event page incorporates color and filler text, while Exhibition pages feature vibrant designs and moving elements for added engagement. 

The information page prioritizes simplicity for optimal readability.
Your planned 2-week development period focuses on animation work, responsive design, and rigorous testing for accessibility and SEO using Lighthouse. 

The final week is allocated for addressing unforeseen challenges, bug fixing, and overall site refinement.
